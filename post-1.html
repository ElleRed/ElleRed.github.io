                    <p>Hey guys! Sorry it's been awhile, I've been trying to figure stuff out blog-designing wise. Writing English is hard, but writing HTML code is even harder, which I learned the hard way (per usual). I'm sorry but I didn't want to spend an hour of my time writing a whole paragraph to center two pictures in my blog post T-T.<br></p>
                    <p>Anyway, no more complaining about computer stuff. If we've ever had a conversation that lasted more than 10 minutes you probably know I have 2 laptops and they both hate me. <em>Dang, I did it again. I gotta quit that. </em>Today though, we're not talking about technology, unfortunately. *Maybe I can do a post later on why I think we really are living in the Matrix and how I can prove it. But today, as you might have guessed by the title, I'm going to talk about 22 things you might not have known about me (and even if you did know, they're weird). Why 22 you ask? Because it's 2022. Yes, you can be upset with me for explaining things that don't need explaining, but at the end of the day, it's my blog and I can write what I want.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>1. I have prosopagnosia.</strong><br>If you've never heard of that, it's a fancy word for <em>face blindness</em>. I found out I had it in 2019, but I've had it for probably as long as I can remember. Yes, it means I cannot remember faces or facial<br> features about someone without looking at them; and no, I can't recognize myself. There were too many times in my college dorm bathroom that I started talking to myself in the mirror only to realize it was just me. I really hope no one saw me do that…<br></p>
                    <p><strong>2. I sometimes sleep with my eyes open.</strong><br>This one freaks people out, but to be fair, a lot of stuff I do freaks people out. At least this one isn't something I do on purpose, right? I wear a sleep mask religiously, otherwise my eyes would dry out and my sister would've kicked me out of our room a lot faster (just kidding, she didn't kick me out. <em>See Faith? I said it, don't kill me</em>). Yeah it makes my eyes dry and itchy sometimes, but hey, it saved me from getting tied up by a kid during a sleepover, so… worth it over all. But that's a story for a different time.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>3. I imitate people.</strong><br>"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery", Oscar Wilde once said. He probably imitated people too. Not in a mean way of course, but if I see someone do an interesting hand gesture, say a word a certain way, or text "lol" after every sentence, then I mimic it. It's bad though when you have an Australian woman at Panera telling you she wants the Asian Sesame salad and you have to repeat the order back and maintain your American accent. <em>I'm sorry lady, I really wasn't trying to be rude.</em><br></p>
                    <p><strong>4. I have an opposable pinky toe.</strong><br>I don't think I need to say anything for this one. I know it's weird.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>5.&nbsp;I can dislocate my shoulders</strong><br>It doesn't hurt, no. It does however creep people out, haha. Someday I'm gonna play a sport and pretend I hurt myself. (Or maybe not, maybe that's too far.)<br></p>
                    <p><strong>6.&nbsp;I'm mixed handed</strong><br>Not quite the same as ambidextrous, because I use different hands for different things. For example, I usually write on paper with my right hand. On chalk or dry-erase board however, I use my left hand. I was born left handed, but over time became right hand dominant. I still try to use my left hand for scissors even though it never works. And I still can't tell my right hand from my left. People tell me to hold up an "L" hand, but when I use my right hand to fingerspell, that doesn't really fix things does it? Hmm. That’s why I ask people "high or low side of the piano?" Cuz that makes more sense to me.<br><br><strong>7. I have a very specific way of eating smarties and skittles</strong><br>I thought everyone did this, but nope, apparently it's just me. With Smarties, you have to separate by color, stack them up, and eat them in order from most to least. Except white go first. And if you have 4 or more white smarties you have to make a wish, cuz that's lucky. So if you have 1 purple, 3 white, 2 orange, and 6 green, you eat them: white, green, orange, then purple. With Skittles you have to eat the red first by themselves (because they're the best, no room for argument), then the rest 2 at a time but mixing the colors. You can't eat 2 of the same color at the same time. Well what if that's all you have left, you ask? Get more. I'm sorry, I don't make the rules-- oh, well, I guess I do actually.<br><br><strong>8. I randomly whistle high notes</strong><br>My family hates me for this.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>9.&nbsp;I hate Ramen noodle soup</strong><br>*<em>Gasp*</em> Hating a college student staple food? Absolutely. I haven't eaten it since I was 6 years old, and I won't ever again. It only takes getting violently ill off of something once to ruin it for you forever. If I have to live off of instant noodles, it's going to be spaghetti rings and meatballs.<br><br><strong>10. I swallowed a dime once</strong><br>I say once like it wasn't last year. And before you think to yourself "How old is she, two?!" I was thinking it through- dimes are the smallest coin. What can I say, it was a dare from a guy in my class (he knows who he is) and I have a habit of doing mildly dangerous things. I will say though the reactions I got and still get from people when they find that out make swallowing currency worth it. And to my other classmate that slapped a quarter out of my<br> hand the day after, I wasn't going to swallow the quarter, that would be stupid. It's much too big.<br><br><strong>11. I see certain words with people</strong><br>If you've seen BBC's Sherlock, you'll know what I'm talking about. <em>If you haven't seen it, go watch it. It's a great&nbsp;show. </em>Yeah, I see words around people when I look at them. It can be several things, or just one, but I haven't met anyone that I don't see anything for. Sometimes it's just their name or MBTI type, or it could be a like or<br> dislike. With my younger sister I see her age and "loves dogs", while with my younger brother I see "crazy", "likes the Office" and "buff". If you want to know what I see when I see you… well I'll have to see you in person first cuz I don't remember what you look like.<br><br><strong>12. I listen to Christmas music year-round</strong><br>I don't understand only listening to a genre of music once a year. I mean we don't only listen to love songs on Valentine's day or Party in the USA in the summer. With the world as sad as it is, why not do the things that make you happy that have no consequences? So no, I'm not taking Santa Tell Me out of my most-played playlist, and if you don't like that, you can "jingle all the way" home.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>13. My "favorite" things are not my favorite things</strong><br>I know this one is confusing. And I don’t know why I do it, I just do. But just because I say something is my favorite thing, doesn't mean I like it best. For instance, my favorite color is lavender, but if I pick colors for anything it's gonna be light blue, cuz I like light blue best. Just know that my "favorite" things are just random picks, while the "best" things are my actual favorites.<br><br><strong>14. I (apparently) have weird food combos</strong><br>I don't know why some of these are weird. Some, I know it <em>sounds</em> bad, but you can't diss it till you've tried it. So far I have: banana and mayo sandwiches, bacon and ice cream, salt and spice cake,<br> salt and pepper on watermelon, and mustard on chocolate cake. If you threw up in your mouth over any of these, I'm sorry for you. You're missing out.<br><br><strong>15. I cannot get up in the hour of 6am-7am</strong><br>It's impossible. I don’t know why. 4am? Sure. 7am? Easy peasy. 6-6:59? Not if my <strong><em>life </em></strong>depended on it. I've tried to change it for years, but alas, I am a hopeless cause. 6 might be scared of 7, but I'm scared of 6.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>16.&nbsp;I study a new topic every year</strong><br>Ok, I guess this isn't really weird but I don't know a lot of people that do it. I pick one topic and study it in depth for a few weeks each year. Now I have a bunch of weird facts and knowledge about the weirdest topics, and people get a kick out of hearing about stuff. Or they kick me. Either way, somebody's getting a kick out of it! A few years ago I did chocolate, in 2020 I did serial killers (I know. But it's good information to know. And it's why I have a list of potential serial killers in my phone.) Last year I did ASL and the Deaf community, which is why I'm planning on getting a degree in ASL now. And this year… well you'll have to wait till I do a whole<br> post on it cuz I have too much to say here.<br><br><strong>17. I know how to play 13 instruments</strong><br>You're still reading? Wow, kudos. Unless you just skipped down and this part caught your eye, but still, kudos, cuz same. Yep, I know how to play 13 instruments. Can I play them super well? No. Would I play all of them in front of someone? Only at gunpoint. But I do know how to play 3 or more songs on 13 instruments, which is why I don’t say I play them, but that I <em>know how</em> to play them. If you're wondering what they are: piano, guitar, harmonica, organ, mandolin, kalimba, cello, violin, xylophone, penny whistle, hand-bells, banjo, and glockenspiel. I also know a little on drum set, bamboo flute and dulcimer, but not enough to count. Also, a tip for harmonica players- NEVER play Count Your Blessings. I tried it once and the 3rd line of the chorus are all draw notes. As I played and the more I sucked in, the darker the room got and I almost passed out. Won't be doing that again but at least it was in my room and not in front of an audience.<br><br><strong>18. I randomly fingerspell and sign things</strong><br>As you saw from #16, I learned a lot of ASL last year. I grew up learning it and actually knew it before I spoke English, but my vocabulary increased fourfold since then. Which means I randomly fingerspell or sign things. In fact, I asked my closest friend what were some of my quirks I could put on here and she said "the way you randomly start signing when you're explaining stuff". What's even funnier is I've caught myself signing in my sleep to music (I woke up and was in the middle of signing a word) and when I had my wisdom teeth pulled this year I apparently just started talking to the nurse in ASL. I'll eventually write a post about why you should learn ASL, but why not throw it in here too. Learn ASL. Take the advice Nike took from Gary Gilmore and Just Do It!<br></p>
                    <p><strong>19.&nbsp;I can flip my eyelids inside out</strong><br>Again, I know, it's weird. I had to hide from my mom to show people cuz she hated it. But if it'll help me win a quarter for a "grossest face contest" then I will do it. Of course, I didn't win the quarter, because I didn't know how to do it at that time, but I vowed to never lose another gross face contest. So far, I haven't! (that's probably not a good thing.)<br><br><strong>20. I can smell the weather</strong><br>Tbh, I thought this was something a lot of people did, but I guess not. Also curse Covid-19 for ruining my sense of smell (and for making me be sick on Christmas); I'm still not as accurate as I used to be. Ask my dormmates from school though, they knew I could do it. In fact, I was so accurate at one point I could tell you in the morning almost the entire forecast for the day. If you're wondering what the word is for what it smells like <em>after</em> it rains, its called Petrichor. Pretty cool if you ask me!<br><br><strong>21. I say "Ow" when things don't hurt</strong><br>Best example of this: I grabbed a paper plate out of a cabinet and dropped it. It floated to the floor gently and when it touched, I stared at it, and said "ow". Did it hurt? Could it have hurt? Definitely not. But I still do it all the time, it's just a weird thing that is part of my personality now.<br><br><strong>22. I like hot cars</strong><br>Ok, when I say hot cars, I don't mean hot wheels or strangely attractive cars like Flint McMissile. You know when you get in your car after it's been out in the sun and it like burns you to sit in? <em>That's </em>what I like. When you can feel your skin tightening from the heat, yeah that. I rarely ever have my air-conditioning on in my car, but I at least try to remember to turn it on if someone else is with me (I'm not a monster, just crazy).<br></p>
                    <p>That was an entirely too long post that you probably didn't fully read, and that's okay. I wouldn't have either. But hey, you're here reading this part, and that's what counts, right? If you did read through all of that, thanks for sticking with me this far! You now know 22 things about me that you might not have known before, or at least a few things more in depth. This was a lot of fun! If you enjoyed reading this be sure to let me know.<br><br>Making melodies,<br>Elle<br><br>*<em>Disclaimer: I don't believe the theory that we're living in the Matrix. That was a joke.</em><br></p>
