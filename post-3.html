                    <p>"Without ice cream there would be darkness and chaos." <br>- Don Kardong<br><br>I have never seen a truer phrase, lol! I love ice cream. Since I was 5 years old I've always said it was my favorite food. So for today's post, I want to talk about an illustration I've had in my head for awhile. June is a month where love is a huge talking point, so I figured now would be a good time to post it. Today<br> we're talking about why Love is like ice cream.<br></p>
                    <h1>Definition</h1>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The word love can have many definitions. Some are accurate, some are not. Everyone has a different view of what love is, often based on the way they grew up or other relationships. Some definitions people come up with are only explaining an<br> action of love, not what love is, while others do not go fully in depth of what love is. Is love a feeling? Is love a choice? Can it really be at first sight or undying? Let's take a look!<br><br>Merriam-Webster defines love as "an intense affection for another person based on a personal or familial tie." However, I don't believe love is a feeling. Loving someone can (and should) produce feelings, but love, in an of itself, is a choice; and not just a choice, love is an action. <br><br><em>Love is choosing to care about someone not because of what they do, but because of who they are.</em><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Like Ice Cream?</h2>
                    <p>Now I know you're thinking, how is that like ice cream?? Well, because love is an action and a choice, there are many things you can say about it. Just like ice cream. <br><br>Ice cream comes in many different flavors. Some flavors are very popular, othersâ€¦ not so much. Love is the same way. Have you ever heard of the 5 love languages? They are-<br> Physical touch, Words of affirmation, Gift giving, Acts of service, and Quality time. I'll illustrate each using ice cream as an example:<br><br>Physical touch: Your friend hugs you while you eat ice cream and cry after a breakup.<br>Words of affirmation: Your mom tells you the ice cream you made tastes amazing!<br>Gift giving: Your sister gives you a gift card to Baskin Robbins, because she knows how much you love their flavors.<br>Acts of service: Your spouse brings you a bowl of ice cream when they went to get their own because they thought you might want some too.<br>Quality time: Your cousin comes over and eats ice cream with you while you have a nice long talk.<br><br>Everyone shows and receives love in some way or another, just like people like certain flavors of ice cream, whether it's loving cotton candy flavored like me, or just loving plain chocolate. Neither are wrong, just different.<br></p>

                            <p class="mb-0"></p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </figure>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Boundaries</h2>
                    <p>Just like ice cream, sometimes you have to set boundaries in your love. Some people are lactose intolerant, and can't eat regular ice cream. So some amazing person decided to make lactose-free ice cream! Some people cannot have dairy or sugar at all, but guess what? There's dairy-free and sugar-free ice cream for them too. There's even ice cream for people who just like fruit (ever heard of a Yonanas?) There's frozen<br> yogurt, custard, sherbet, and gelato, soft-serve and scooped, milkshakes and popsicles.<br><br>In the same way that you can adjust ice cream to fit your needs, you can set boundaries in your relationships to ensure your love is valued correctly. Communication is <em>always </em>key. If you need space, ask for space! If you need less of one love language and more of another, tell them that! No one knows what they don't know, and if a person loves you, they will listen to what you have to say. <br><br>On the reverse side, do not be offended when someone needs to set boundaries with you. You know I love ice cream, but I also can't eat it everyday for every meal. When someone asks you to respect their boundaries, they are only asking you to show them love in a way that's easier for them to see.<br></p><a href="#"></a>
                    <h1>Love is</h1>
                    <p>Love is running with your friends after the ice cream truck to get your favorite popsicles. Love is laughing while you cut up chocolate pieces with your parents to put in the homemade ice cream churn. Love is getting ice cream from Marble Slab with your soulmate while walking downtown holding hands. Love is getting ice cream on your nose "on accident" to make your kid laugh when they're upset. Love is tasting a new ice cream for the first time and knowing it's your new favorite flavor. Love is the way ice cream refreshes you on a hot day and gives you comfort when you are sad. Love is chocolate and vanilla, butter pecan and cookies and cream.<br></p>
                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>"Without ice cream there would be darkness and chaos." And without love, the world is filled with nothing but darkness and chaos. I hope (if you like ice cream, or some version of it) you will think of it in a different way now. And as Franklin P. Jones says, "Love isn't what makes the world go around. Love<br> is what makes the ride worthwhile." &lt;0O<br><br>Love you like ice cream!<br>Elle</p>
