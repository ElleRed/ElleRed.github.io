                    <p>Wow. My first blog post. For the record, I have no idea what I’m doing. It’s like that moment when you just keyboard smash and hope it makes a few words so you know where to start. So if you’re reading this post, thanks for joining me on the crazy adventure of running a blog.<br><br>I became a student of Bob Jones last fall, and man, has it been amazing. I’ve learned a ton, made so many new friends and even more great memories. But in between all of the hustle and bustle of being a full-time student and having a couple part-time jobs, there are several things I wish I had known before my first semester here. I guess it’s true what they say, you learn from your<br>mistakes… and boy did I have plenty to learn from. We’ll just stick with 10 things for now though. Maybe the rest can be in a part two, haha.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Do not weigh down your backpack<br>Tl;dr, just keep essentials in your backpack, not your textbooks. Save your shoulders.<br>We all wanna do it. "But what if I need my books?" You won't.<br>Seriously, I haven't used any of my books in class (ok actually, English class you will but that's pretty much it. And those books are small.) My recommendation? Get a 5-subject notebook, keep that in your backpack at all times, and if you need it, your English book. Save the rest of the space for snacks or whatever you will actually need. Here's stuff that has been a life saver for me to have in my backpack:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ○ Snacks- don't do chocolate. It'll melt. <br>Crackers- yes <br>Fruity candy- yes <br>Tube of M&amp;Ms- no. They won't melt but the shaking sound will make everyone want to murder you.<br>○ Deodorant- vital. Especially when you have a class with your school crush. Or your teacher asks you a question you don't know the answer to. <br>○ Stain remover stick- also vital. Believe me, you will find stains you have no idea what they are or where they came from. That's college for ya.<br>○ Lots of pens (specifically erasable ones. Seriously, they're the best. Get them. It's like 4 bucks for a pack of 3.)<br>○ Phone/laptop charger- and bring a charger box for it.<br>○ A rain jacket- I know it sounds stupid but if you know how to fold it small, you never have to worry about a cold classroom robbing your concentration or the crazy SC weather ruining your amazing outfit and the hour you spent missing breakfast to fix your hair and makeup.<br>○ Scissors- you might think you won't use them; you will. Just keep them.<br>○ A mini stationary set- mini stapler and remover, mini tape dispenser, mini hole punch- there's no telling how many times someone needed a stapler and I whipped my baby stapler out to the rescue. Man, now that I'm thinking about it, I should've charged. $1 per staple. Would've had enough money to pay for that meal plan I keep hearing about.<br>Now I know you’re thinking all that stuff is gonna weigh your backpack down, but hey, at least it's lighter than your high school backpack, right? (If you were homeschooled and didn't have a backpack before, same.) It's still not as heavy as 20 textbooks. Those things are like cinder blocks. I'm convinced the college textbook inventors came up with a diabolical, Doctor Who-esque type of paper that's heavier on the inside. I mean, it's just a 300 page book, I shouldn't be struggling to carry it as much as I struggle to read it.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>&nbsp; 2. Pay attention to where your classes are before you sign up.<br>The past 2 semesters, I wasn't smart enough to look at the map when I picked my classes. Please do not be me. Mostly because I have a nonstop identity crisis anyway and I don't need someone who's also me, confusing me; but also because I made a terrible mistake and my classes were sooo far apart. If you don't want to be walking from one side of campus to the other in less than 10<br>min, and you also hate running up 2 flights of stairs in Alumni, just look at where the classes are held.</p>
                    <p>3. Get snacks from Dollar tree<br>Vending machines suck. I said what I said. They're overpriced and then they just like to test your patience by getting your drink stuck after you paid for it and you have to fight the urge to kick the glass or try to master telekinesis like the Scarlet Witch to will the bottle out. Dollar Tree sadly betrayed me and made stuff $1.25 (it's not Dollar Tree if it's NOT A DOLLAR. Ok ok, I'll calm down now.) but hey, it's still cheaper than Vending Machines. Spend $10, go get a bunch of snacks, keep a variety in your backpack and forget that that kid ever saw you doing Wanda Maximoff hands™ at your mountain dew in the vending machine. They're gonna tell they're friends, but you don't know them, so it's ok.<br></p>
                    <p>4. Park on the roof if you can't park on 1st floor of parking garage. Again, I learned this one the hard way. I don't know how to explain it, you're just gonna have to trust me on this one. If you don't trust me cuz you're like:<em>&nbsp;I don't even know this girl, I'm just procrastinating on my Algebra homework,&nbsp;</em>I get it (you should do your homework instead of reading this though). But if you don't want to get stuck behind a trail of cars from the 4th and 3rd floors, just park on the roof.</p>
                    <p>5. Bob Jones qualifies for the AOTC. <br>This is the most important one I have for you BJU students, present or incoming. The American Opportunity Tax Credit allows college students to take credit for some of their paid tuition. It varies as to the amount, but it can be up to $2,500! So do yourself a favor and next time you file your taxes make sure you fill out the form for the AOTC. I mean come on, who doesn't want more money? Crazy people, that's who.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>6. Theatre projects take a lot of time and effort.<br>I just want to take a moment to say kudos to every Theatre major in the entire world, because I would die if I were you.&nbsp;<br>Bob Jones is famous around the world for it's fine arts productions, and while they are a lot of fun and amazingly produced, they will tax you in almost every way.<br>I was in <em>Samson et Delilah </em>this year, and it was an awesome experience with tons of great memories and friendships made. <em>However.</em>&nbsp;I won't tell you I cried my eyes out after every week from exhaustion, but I&nbsp;cried my eyes out after every week from exhaustion. If you want to be part of a big production at BJU, which you definitely should at one point or another, DON'T do it during a semester where you're taking 17 credits and working 2 jobs. You're probably thinking "What kind of moron would do that?" Well you know what? Nobody told me how much work an Opera was, so there. At least you have me to tell you right now, because you probably wouldn't have known either.<br></p>
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-gray-900);">7. 8 am classes are only worth it if you don't have many classes that day.<br>I'm a townie, so I have to drive to class everyday. Now you might not know this, but Greenville, SC has the worst drivers in the entire United States of America. (You think I'm joking? Look it up. Or drive around Greenville for 10 min. You'll see.) So if you're a townie, you definitely don't want a lot of 8 am classes. If you're a dorm student... still no. No one wants to get up that early, even early birds, unless you only have a few classes. This semester I only have 2 classes on the days I have 8 ams. Do I go home and sleep after? No, but it's still easier to get through than last year when I had 4 classes after the 8 am. Honestly, I'm not sure how I lived after that. Maybe I didn't. :0&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>8. Don't get a Chromebook.<br>Another mistake I've made that I will try to spare you from is getting a Chromebook for school. Don't get me wrong, I like Chromebooks, but not at BJU. See, Bob Jones relies heavily on Microsoft Office, and guess what doesn't work with Microsoft? Yeah. You're smart, you know that? And since you're smart, stick to a Windows laptop. I'm writing this on my old laptop that only works when it's plugged in, and I cry when I think about how much money I spent on a Chromebook I can't use for 90% of my school projects. You don't wanna waste your money buying Kleenex or makeup remover wipes because you're also crying about your choice of laptop. Save that money for important stuff, like buying a pineapple for the girl you're taking to Artist Series.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;You think that's weird to say, but I saw it.</em>&nbsp;Pineapple guy if you're reading this, <strong>nice.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg"></a><span class="text-muted caption">BJU class of 2025. Maybe you can find me in there.</span>
                    <p>9. Put effort into your Success Map.<br>I think I'm the only person on campus who actually liked Pathways, but that's okay. I mean come on, if it's required, you might as well like it. Except for Essential Science... just don't think about that. <em>*shudders*</em><br>ANYWAY, the Success Map is a project in Pathways, and it might seem dumb but seriously, it's gonna be a lifesaver later when you're freaking out about finals and packing and White Glove and the school keeps emailing you about reserving classes for next semester. You can always change your mind later, but having something to go off of will take a lot of pressure off you.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>10. Join a society with at least a couple friends.<br>When I was asking for advice about societies before Rush, someone told me, "Don't join a society because you have a lot of friends joining it." To whoever said that- I don't like you. <br>-_-<br>That's harsh, and I'm kidding about that (mostly), but don't listen to that advice. Society is mainly for friends. Sure, you'll make a lot of new friends when you join a society, but it'll be a lot easier to get adjusted when you have friends joining you.</p>
                    <p>Congrats! You made it all the way to the end of this post, which was unnecessarily long. Sure, you might have scrolled to the end, but hey, you scrolled on my post. That means something, right?<br>Seriously though, thanks for reading. Hopefully something I said made sense. Half the time I'm looking for my marbles, so I don't even know. But you do!<br>We'll see if I come back with a part two.<br><br>Making melodies,<br>Elle</p>
