                    <p>I am currently working on writing a year-long devotional book (which is taking me forever) and sometimes I'm like, <em>I just </em><strong><em>have</em></strong><em> to share this with somebody! </em>God has showed me a lot of things I've never thought about before while writing it, and I can't wait till it's finished and ready to share. However, some things I feel are important enough to share now rather than later. Every so often I might post an entry, or I'll draw from it, like I'm going to do in this post. But if I ever finish it and you ever read my devotional book, don't skip through it cuz you've "read it already" T-T.<br></p>
                    <p>There are very few people that know my story. I've been very unsure about sharing it for a long time, and I haven't because of that. But I've decided to push past that fear and share, because I hope to be able to encourage someone in telling my story. <br><br><em>That being said, it's not an easy story to read. I want to give a fair warning, if it bothers you to read&nbsp; about abuse, please don't read this. &lt;3</em><br></p>
                    <h3>Life on the Road</h3>
                    <p>By the time I was 10 years old, I had traveled to 20 states and over 100,000 miles. By the time I had my 17th birthday, I had been to almost 40 states and traveled over 200,000 miles. See, my dad was an evangelist. We spent 40+ weeks out of the year traveling, spending a week at one church, then moving to the next. One week we'd be in one state, and the next week we'd be in another. I only saw my friends once a year. I saw my extended family maybe 7 or 8 times a year, but usually not much more than that. I've seen the St. Louis Arch 4 times and Mount Rushmore 5 times. I've been to the Grand Canyon and seen the Badlands of SD. I swam in the Missouri River, and even poured a bottle of water from the Pacific Ocean into<br> the Atlantic.<br><br><span style="background-color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Now that sounds like a lot of fun (maybe). And it was sometimes. Looking down at a baseball stadium from the top of the Arch and seeing the vast expanse of the Grand Canyon are not memories I'll soon forget. But that wasn't life most days.</span></p>
                    <h3>Life Behind the Curtain</h3>
                    <p><em>Here's where it gets very... Open. </em><br><br>Unfortunately, the "Christian" home I grew up in was Christian in name only. My parents were very abusive, both emotionally, mentally, and physically.&nbsp; It gradually got worse and moved on to more than just those categories. Everyday life was a struggle, and fear and pain were very familiar feelings. My brothers and I were completely alone in our<br> suffering, because the secret was very well kept. It was easy to keep a secret when you only saw people for a week. <br><br>Going through life like that was so so hard, and trusting God and His plan was equally hard. There were many times where I questioned Him, asking why He would allow my brothers<br> and I to be hurt this way or why He let it continue. I felt no relief, comfort, or end to my heartache and pain. As I read through the Bible, I found Psalm 77 to be very relatable.<br></p>
                    <h3>Changing Perspective</h3>
                    <p>Then in 2018, things got a little better. Did the abuse go away? No. But God changed my perspective. One evening I was reading my Bible (I always spend God and I time at night) and I came across Phil. 4:11: Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, <em>in whatsoever state&nbsp;</em>I am, therewith to be content (KJV). And it hit me. I was in Arizona at this time, thousands of miles from home. The Lord showed me that verse and it was like He spoke to me, "It doesn't matter if you're in Arizona, or South Carolina, or South Dakota. No matter what state you are in, I will help you to be content." That phrase suddenly had a double meaning for me. Not only<br>was God with me in the state of life I was living in, but also the state I currently was living in as well!</p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post2art.jpg" style="transform: translate(-17px) scale(0.95);"><sub>The picture I drew in 2018 to go along with what I learned.</sub>

                        </blockquote>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the midst of a very hard circumstance, God showed me that He was with me. And as bad as things get, I try never to forget that. Whether I'm in one state or another, happy or sad, hurting or rejoicing, stressed or relieved, God is with me. And I can be content in that knowledge.<br></p>
                    <p>Are you going through a hard time? Does it feel like God just isn't there? I totally get it. But you can claim the promise He gives to help you be content! The problem doesn't have to go away for things to feel better. And to be brutally honest,<br> it's not going to feel better most of the time. But you can trust God in spite of the pain. And that will give you a peace beyond our understanding.<br><br><strong><em>If you or a loved one is struggling&nbsp;through an abuse situation, please reach out to me or someone else you know and&nbsp;trust. No one deserves to live in that and I and others would love to help.</em></strong><br><strong><em> &lt;3</em></strong><br></p>
