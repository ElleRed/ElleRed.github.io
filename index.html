        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Criminal Justice. I want to be a Victims Advocate. I am also currently learning ASL, and will hopefully get my interpreting degree in the future.</p>
             
         <p> In between school, I work 2 jobs; one, a cashier at Panera and two, cleaning houses.</p>
         <p>
            I love singing, playing piano and guitar, and drawing digital art. I also love taking pictures of the sky and reading about/ watching movies about psychology.
