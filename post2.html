                    <p> I am currently working on writing a year-long devotional book (which is taking me forever) and sometimes I'm like, I just have to share this with somebody! God has showed me a lot of things I've never thought about before while writing it, and I can't wait till it's finished and ready to share. However, some things I feel are important enough to share now rather than later. Every so often I might post an entry, or I'll draw from it, like I'm going to do in this post. But if I ever finish it and you ever read my devotional book, don't skip through it cuz you've "read it already" T-T.</p>                 
                    <p>&nbsp; There are very few people that know my story. I've been very unsure about sharing it for a long time, and I haven't because of that. But I've decided to push past that fear and share, because I hope to be able to encourage someone in telling my story. </p>
                    <p> That being said, it's not an easy story to read. I want to give a fair warning, if it bothers you to read  about abuse, please don't read this. <3 </p>
                    <p>em>&nbsp;I don't even know this girl, I'm just procrastinating on my Algebra homework,&nbsp;</em>I get it (you should do your homework instead of reading this though). But if you don't want to get stuck behind a trail of cars from the 4th and 3rd floors, just park on the roof.</p>
                    <p>5. Bob Jones qualifies for the AOTC. <br>This is the most important one I have for you BJU students, present or incoming. The American Opportunity Tax Credit allows college students to take credit for some of their paid tuition. It varies as to the amount, but it can be up to $2,500! So do yourself a favor and next time you file your taxes make sure you fill out the form for the AOTC. I mean come on, who doesn't want more money? Crazy people, that's who.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>6. Theatre projects take a lot of time and effort.<br>I just want to take a moment to say kudos to every Theatre major in the entire world, because I would die if I were you.&nbsp;<br>Bob Jones is famous around the world for it's fine arts productions, and while they are a lot of fun and amazingly produced, they will tax you in almost every way.<br>I was in <em>Samson et Delilah </em>this year, and it was an awesome experience with tons of great memories and friendships made. <em>However.</em>&nbsp;I won't tell you I cried my eyes out after every week from exhaustion, but I&nbsp;cried my eyes out after every week from exhaustion. If you want to be part of a big production at BJU, which you definitely should at one point or another, DON'T do it during a semester where you're taking 17 credits and working 2 jobs. You're probably thinking "What kind of moron would do that?" Well you know what? Nobody told me how much work an Opera was, so there. At least you have me to tell you right now, because you probably wouldn't have known either.<br></p>
                    <p style="color: var(--bs-gray-900);">7. 8 am classes are only worth it if you don't have many classes that day.<br>I'm a townie, so I have to drive to class everyday. Now you might not know this,4. Park on the roof if you can't park on 1st floor of parking garage. Again, I learned this one the hard way. I don't know how to explain it, you're just gonna have to trust me on this one. If you don't trust me cuz you're like:< but Greenville, SC has the worst drivers in the entire United States of America. (You think I'm joking? Look it up. Or drive around Greenville for 10 min. You'll see.) So if you're a townie, you definitely don't want a lot of 8 am classes. If you're a dorm student... still no. No one wants to get up that early, even early birds, unless you only have a few classes. This semester I only have 2 classes on the days I have 8 ams. Do I go home and sleep after? No, but it's still easier to get through than last year when I had 4 classes after the 8 am. Honestly, I'm not sure how I lived after that. Maybe I didn't. :0&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>8. Don't get a Chromebook.<br>Another mistake I've made that I will try to spare you from is getting a Chromebook for school. Don't get me wrong, I like Chromebooks, but not at BJU. See, Bob Jones relies heavily on Microsoft Office, and guess what doesn't work with Microsoft? Yeah. You're smart, you know that? And since you're smart, stick to a Windows laptop. I'm writing this on my old laptop that only works when it's plugged in, and I cry when I think about how much money I spent on a Chromebook I can't use for 90% of my school projects. You don't wanna waste your money buying Kleenex or makeup remover wipes because you're also crying about your choice of laptop. Save that money for important stuff, like buying a pineapple for the girl you're taking to Artist Series.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;You think that's weird to say, but I saw it.</em>&nbsp;Pineapple guy if you're reading this, <strong>nice.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg"></a><span class="text-muted caption">BJU class of 2025. Maybe you can find me in there.</span>
                    <p>9. Put effort into your Success Map.<br>I think I'm the only person on campus who actually liked Pathways, but that's okay. I mean come on, if it's required, you might as well like it. Except for Essential Science... just don't think about that. <em>*shudders*</em><br>ANYWAY, the Success Map is a project in Pathways, and it might seem dumb but seriously, it's gonna be a lifesaver later when you're freaking out about finals and packing and White Glove and the school keeps emailing you about reserving classes for next semester. You can always change your mind later, but having something to go off of will take a lot of pressure off you.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>10. Join a society with at least a couple friends.<br>When I was asking for advice about societies before Rush, someone told me, "Don't join a society because you have a lot of friends joining it." To whoever said that- I don't like you. <br>-_-<br>That's harsh, and I'm kidding about that (mostly), but don't listen to that advice. Society is mainly for friends. Sure, you'll make a lot of new friends when you join a society, but it'll be a lot easier to get adjusted when you have friends joining you.</p>
                    <p>Congrats! You made it all the way to the end of this post, which was unnecessarily long. Sure, you might have scrolled to the end, but hey, you scrolled on my post. That means something, right?<br>Seriously though, thanks for reading. Hopefully something I said made sense. Half the time I'm looking for my marbles, so I don't even know. But you do!<br>We'll see if I come back with a part two.<br><br>Making melodies,<br>Elle</p>
