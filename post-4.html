                    <p>This is my first movie review in writing. I might take notes in the theater for myself or rant to my friends about the latest blockbuster, but I have never written a full review somewhere for people to read. So we'll see how this turns out, and maybe after that I'll do another one.<br><br>Now the first, and big question is, what movie should I do first? It took me a long time to decide (if you consider 5 minutes a long time) but I finally decided to do my favorite<br> Marvel movie- Spiderman: No Way Home! If you haven't seen it yet, I'm weeping for you. And I'm telling you if you have miraculously avoided spoilers and want to avoid them, don't read this. If you have watched the movie, yay! I hope you<br> enjoy this rundown.<br></p>
                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>The plot in Spiderman: No Way Home was very well written, because it is simple yet complex, full of nostalgia and great fan-service, and has great lessons to learn. Let me do a simple recap of the plot: after the events of Spiderman: Far From Home, Peter, finding himself smothered with too much popularity and undeserved consequences, seeks help from Dr. Strange. Stephen tries to use a spell to make people forget who Spiderman is, but the spell is botched, which opens the<br> multiverse. Now villains from the past two Spiderman series are being drawn into the MCU, villains such as Doc Ock, Sandman, Electro, Lizard, and most importantly, the Green Goblin. Aunt May guides Peter to try to heal the villains instead of follow Dr. Strange's plan to send them back to their<br> respective universes to die. While trying to heal them, Green Goblin goes berserk and kills Aunt May, the other villains following suit, except for Doc Ock, who was healed beforehand. The death of Aunt May sends Peter into hiding<br> and Ned and MJ start to wonder what to do. Ned accidently opens a portal that introduces Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker, and then a second one bringing Tobey Maguire's Peter back to the silver screen. Together, the 3 Peter's work together to cure the villains, including Green Goblin, after an intense fight scene and wisdom from Tobey's Peter. However, the broken spell Doctor Strange tried to previously contain breaks open, splitting the sky open to bring anyone who knows Peter Parker into the MCU. Peter sacrificially asks Strange to create a new spell to make everyone forget Peter Parker, knowing that this choice will leave him completely alone. Strange does so, saving the world, but destroying<br> Peter's. He goes to make contact with MJ and Ned after, but believes they are better off without him, and instead maintains a healthy distance. At the end of the movie we see Peter making the decision to still fight crime as Spiderman,<br> with a new suit now.<br></p>
                    <h2>Lessons</h2>
                    <p>There are several great lessons to learn in this movie, but 2 overall themes: Forgiveness and sacrifice. No Way Home demonstrates the importance of forgiving and the nobility of sacrifice in a very poignant way. Peter Parker has lost much in<br> every universe, but the MCU has brought that loss to a new level, which is only increased in this movie. Yet not only does Peter 1 learn to forgive and make sacrifices, but we see from Peter 2 and 3 that they have learned to do this as well. (In case you're not sure, Peter 1 is Tom Holland, 2 is Tobey and 3 is Andrew, based on the movie.) When Peters 2 and 3 come to see Peter 1 on top of the school after May's death, they share an emotional moment and tell Peter 1 how they lost the people they loved. They further explain how they had to make<br> a choice- they could get revenge out of anger, or forgive and learn to serve others instead. The plot point of having Peter heal Norman Osborne after seeing him so brutally kill his aunt is phenomenal, and very different from your average superhero movie.<br><br>Not only is forgiveness a big theme, but sacrifice is equally big. Peter obviously makes the biggest sacrifice you could make, because even though he is still living, his life has been erased. However, we see the little steps along the way that Peter makes that leads him to be able to sacrifice so much when the time comes. He asks Strange for help with a spell, not because of his own issues, but because the consequences of being known have hurt his friends too. We see his sacrifice in his desire to help people even while they hate him, going as far as sliming him and graffitiing hate against him. Further, his sacrifice is seen in his willingness to put his own safety at risk for the villains and not satisfy his desire to kill them in revenge.<br><br>Peter's story in No Way Home shows us that even in the hardest of situations, we always have the choice and the responsibility to do what's right.<br></p>
                    <h2>Favorite Moments</h2>
                    <p>Okay okay, that was super deep, let's do something fun now. Here's some of my favorite moments in Spiderman: No Way Home.<br>• MJ and Peter's chemistry<br>• Ned and his "sparking fingers"<br>• The reminiscent soundtrack <br>• Willem Dafoe's outstanding performance <br>• The way they portray the Goblin more like a split personality<br>• Peter 3 being able to save MJ as a redemption for Gwen's death<br>• "I do have the Spider-tingle, just not for bread."<br>• May being Peter 1's Uncle Ben<br>• The whole movie being Peter 1's origin story<br></p>
                    <h2>Rating</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgb(46, 117, 181);">10/10</span><br><br>This is officially my favorite Marvel movie, has been since I left the theater the first time (and the next four times). It has everything I could've hoped for in it. Perfection at it's finest. Yep, Marvel peaked with this. And if anyone is wondering which Peter Parker is the best, there's only one right answer. <br><br><strong>They're brothers. They're all the best.</strong><br></p>
                    <p>Well this was fun! For me at least. If this movie review wasn't what you were hoping for, I'm sorry. Don't read the next ones. If you liked it, let me know!<br><br>Till next time,<br>Elle Redmond<br></p>
